    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "Based solely on the contents of the LIAB-AUTO-001 policy, coverage applies only to third-party bodily injury liabilities and does not extend to vehicle damage or self-injury. Therefore, any claim for damages related to the insured’s own vehicle or personal injuries will not be covered under this policy. Claims for bodily injury to others and related liabilities, if within policy limits, are covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy language leads to the conclusion that approval of credit for claims depends entirely on whether the claim falls within covered liabilities (third-party bodily injury). Coverage is clearly stated as limited to liability only, which must be strictly validated against the claim details.\n",

      "Analysis:\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim filed by policyholder John Peterson covers an incident on July 17, 2025, involving his 2004 Honda Accord that was parked when another vehicle collided with its front left side. The incident description is detailed with witness and police report references. \n",
      "- Documentation: The claim includes photos of the vehicle damage, police report PDF, and repair shop estimate. Photos and damage descriptions indicate severe front-left damage, including the bumper, fender, headlamp, and possible mechanical issues.\n",
      "- Damage & Repair Estimates: The damage described aligns well with the photographic evidence and repair shop documentation. The extent of visible damage supports the request for coverage of repair costs minus deductible.\n",
      "- Completeness & Consistency: All critical fields are complete including witness contacts, police report, and repair shop details. No discrepancies or inconsistencies were observed in the claim data.\n",
      "- Policy Reference: No direct retrieval of policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 was found to assess specific coverage terms for this liability auto policy. However, the claim scenario appears typical for a collision coverage request.\n",
      "- Risk & Authenticity: There are no indications of fraud or suspicious patterns in the claim. The data is consistent, supported by third-party evidence, and timely filed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "- Policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 was not located, so exact coverage limits, exclusions, or deductibles could not be confirmed.\n",
      "- Confirmation needed on deductible amount and if it aligns with the claimant’s request.\n",
      "- Verification of repair estimate amounts against industry or regional standards would improve cost reasonableness validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "1. Locate and review the full insurance policy LIAB-AUTO-001 to confirm coverage scope, limits, and deductible requirements.\n",
      "2. Verify repair cost estimates with at least one independent auto repair expert or pricing database.\n",
      "3. Confirm claimant’s requested coverage minus deductible aligns with policy terms.\n",
      "4. Approve claim for payment if policy confirms coverage and repair costs are justified.\n",
      "5. Communicate clearly with claimant regarding coverage and expected payout after deductible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, based on available data, this is a valid claim with proper documentation and reasonable damage assessment. With policy review and cost verification, approval is recommended.\n",

      "────────────────────────────────────────\n",
      "I have retrieved detailed claim data for claim ID CL001. The claim involves a 2004 Honda Accord owned by John Peterson, with an incident dated July 17, 2025. The vehicle was legally parked in a lot when it was struck on the front end and driver’s side by a gray pickup truck. There is substantial documented damage including front bumper detachment, denting and scrapes on the driver’s side, and possible mechanical damage behind the bumper. Supporting evidence includes witness and police reports, repair shop estimates, and photos showing significant front-left damage. Additionally, there is a separate recent crash record under a different policy for the same claimant but a different vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the search for the related policy documents by policy number LIAB-AUTO-001 did not return any results. This limits the ability to directly verify coverage, deductibles, and exclusions from the policy text itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next steps:\n",
      "- As Claim Reviewer Agent, I will review the claim documentation completeness, validate damage estimates and repair costs against the data, and assess whether the evidence supports the claim.\n",
      "- As Risk Analyst Agent, I will analyze this claim for fraud indicators including timing, amounts, inconsistencies, or repetitive claims for the same insured.\n",

      "- Completeness: The claim includes a detailed incident description, damage description, witness information, police report details, and repair shop estimate. Evidence attached includes photos of vehicle damage, police report (PDF), and repair estimate, indicating a thorough submission.\n",
      "- Damage Estimates: The repair request is for full coverage of repair expenses minus deductible. Damage documented includes front bumper detachment, severe fender and door damage, tire damage, paint transfer, and possible hidden mechanical damage. Photos and repair shop estimate support these claims.\n",
      "- Evidence: The witness and police reports confirm the incident and other driver’s responsibility. Photographic evidence visually confirms the reported damage. The repair shop is a recognized local facility.\n",
      "- Cross-Reference: The nature and extent of damage are consistent with a parking lot side-swipe collision. Repair claims appear reasonable and within expected costs for described damage. No unusual or inflated amounts noted.\n",
      "- Additional Information: The claimant has a second recent crash under a different policy and vehicle, but no overlap in claims on this policy or vehicle.\n",

      "- Amounts: Repair estimates appear normal for the described damage, no signs of excessive or repetitive claim amounts under this policy.\n",
      "- Multiple Claims: No suspicious clustering on this particular policy or vehicle; additional crash is on separate policy and vehicle.\n",
